I Overview
This package contains all libraries needed to build an almost complete complete version of GPAC version 0.2.2.
To find out more about non included libraries in this package, please refer to GPAC install documentation.

See each package for License terms.

All packages are configure to compile "out of the box" for Win32 VC6 and WinCE eVC3

Windows Users:

If you wish to use different versions of these packages, you MUST update the headers included in the GPAC distribution (gpac/extra_lib/include/*) and copy 
the compiled libraries in the appropriate directory in the GPAC distribution (gpac/extra_lib/lib/$platform_build) where $platform_build is one of:
	* w32_debug: win32 platform, debug version (MSVC6 compiler)
	* w32_release: win32 platform, release version (MSVC6 compiler)
	* arm_debug: ARM PocketPC win32 platform, debug version (MS eVC3 compiler)
	* arm_release: ARM PocketPC win32 platform, release version (MS eVC3 compiler)

The simplest way is to copy the entire content of the build dir (eg gpac_extra_lib/lib/*) to the gpac lib dir (gpac/extra_lib/lib/)

GCC Users:

If you wish to use different versions of these packages and are not planing to install these packages on your system:
* you MUST update the headers included in the GPAC distribution (gpac/extra_lib/include/*) 
* you MUST copy the compiled lib in gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc in the GPAC distribution. Unlike for Windows The package files are not output in gpac_extra_lib/lib/gcc,  you will have to look for them...

FFMPEG fans:
If you plan to use a different FFMPEG version than the one included in this package, you will need to copy (unless installing ffmpeg on your system)
	ffmpeg/libavcodec: avcodec.h common.h rational.h
	ffmpeg/libavformat: avformat.h avio.h
to gpac/extra_lib/include/ffmpeg, and to remove from avformat.h the lines:
	#include "rtp.h"
	#include "rtsp.h"
	
(ffmpeg rtp is disabled in gpac)


II Compiling with MS VC6

	II.1 Regular Libraries
	- Open IDEs/VC6/BuildAll.dsw
	- do Build->Batch Build , (re) build All

	II.2 Compiling ffmpeg for win32
	- get MinGW installed on your system (cf http://www.mingw.org) 
	- get in ffmpeg directory
	- type ./configure --enable-shared --disable-debug (you may need to specify --enable-memalign-hack. You may want to specify --disable-encoders to get a smaller
	dll but the gain is not really important)
	- type make
	- all libraries and DLLs are in lib/w32_debug and lib/w32_release - copy those libraries to gpac/extra_lib/lib/w32_debug and gpac/extra_lib/lib/w32_release

	II.3 GPAC Configuring
	- all libraries are in lib/w32_debug and lib/w32_release (even ffmpeg ones) - copy those libraries to gpac/extra_lib/lib/w32_debug and gpac/extra_lib/lib/w32_release
	- all DLLs are in lib/w32_debug and lib/w32_release (even ffmpeg ones) - copy those DLLs to gpac/bin/Debug and gpac/bin/Release
	- if you plan to compile the GDIplus plugin in GPAC, also install GDIplus (cf section V)

	
III Compiling with MS eVC3

	- Open IDEs/eVC3/BuildAll.vcw
	- do Build->Batch Build , (re) build All
	- FFMPEG IS NOT AVAILABLE ON THE POCKETPC PLATFORM, DON'T TRY TO COMPILE IT.
	- all libraries are in lib/arm_debug and lib/arm_release - copy those libraries to gpac/extra_lib/lib/arm_debug and gpac/extra_lib/lib/arm_release
	- all DLLs are in lib/arm_debug and lib/arm_release - copy those DLLs to gpac/bin/arm_debug and gpac/bin/arm_release


IV Compiling with GCC
	NOTES: 
	 *	As said above, the files are not output in gpac_extra_lib/lib/gcc you will have to look for them and copy them in gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc in the GPAC distribution
	 *	If you are not installing these libraries on your system and use shared version (.so, .dll), you MUST update your environment settings so that the shared libraries may be 
	found (usually LD_LIBRARY_PATH). As a general rule you'd better compile as static libs if you don't want to install the libs on your system. You may want to copy the shared 
	libraries to gpac/bin/gcc, but this is optional
	 * if you are installing the libraries on your system, just type 'make install' once each library is successfully compiled
	
	IV.1 Compiling faad2
			./bootstrap
			./configure
			make
			if you're not installing this lib on the system, copy libfaad.a to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc
	
	IV.2 Compiling FreeType
			./configure
			make
			if you're not installing this lib on the system, copy libfreetype.a to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc
			
	IV.3 Compiling ffmpeg
			./configure --disable-debug --disable-encoders
			make
			NOTE: DO NOT specify --enable-shared under MinGW if you're building GPAC with GCC
			if you're not installing this lib on the system, copy libavcodec.a and libavformat.a to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc (they may be called avcodec.lib and avformat.lib under MinGW)
			
	IV.4 Compiling JS
		* js under MinGW:
			cd js/fdmlib
			cp makefile.mingw Makefile
			make
			cd js/
			cp makefile.mingw makefile
			Make
			if you're not installing this lib on the system, copy js/libjs.a to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc and js/js.dll to gpac/bin/gcc
			
		* js with other GCC build
			make -f Makefile.ref (cf js/Readme.html or WWW)
			if you're not installing this lib on the system, copy js/libjs.a to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc and js/js.so to gpac/bin/gcc
			
	IV.5 Compiling libjpg 
			./configure
			make
			NOTE1: you MUST copy the generated jconfig.h (except under MinGW) to gpac/extra_lib/include/jpeg if you're not installing the jpeg lib on the system
			NOTE2: this will erase the win32 config file (jconfig.h) for VC6 and EVC3, a backup file is provided (jconfig.win32) for later rebuild
			if you're not installing this lib on the system, copy libjpeg.a to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc

V Detailed Content
	Listing of all libraries, versions and modifications to original source tree
	
** faad2
	faad2 library version 2.1 beta (CVS 09/03/2004), modified to compile without VC6 processor pack
	
** ffmpeg
	official cvs tarball from 26/09/2004, modified to compile without encoders/writers (smaller for win32 DLL)
	removed testing directory.
	fixed libavformat/mov.c to support seeking on QT files with ignored tracks (like swf ones)

** freetype
	freetype 2.1.7 library
	freetype/builds/winCE: added workspace/project files for embeddedVC
	Modified freetype/include/freetype/config/ftstdlib.h for WinCE compilation (offsetof definition)

** js
	SpiderMonkey v1.5 RC 4 JavaScript interpreter
	/js/src: added MSVC and eVC workspace/project files
	NOTE: the code has been quite modified for WinCE compilation (look for XP_WINCE and js/winCE directory)
	NOTE2: to compile with RC5 of spiderMonkey you will need to modify the code and replace XP_PC by XP_WIN / XP_UNIX in the GPAC configure script
	
** libjpg
	IJG JPEG implementation Version 6b. Added project files for MSVC and eVC
	modified for WinCE compilation (look for _WIN32_CE_)
	modified jconfig.win32 to support both win32 and MinGW

** libpng
	Official LibPNG software, version 1.2.5 
	/libpng/projects/EVC: added workspace/project files for embeddedVC
	
** libmad
	libMAD library version 0.15.1b
	/mad/msevc/libmad: added workspace/project files for embeddedVC
	modified mad.h for WinCE compileatio (FPM_ARM fixed-point doesn't compile, winCE uses FPM_DEFAULT fixed-point)

** xvidcore
	xvid codec 1.0 rc3
	/xvidcore/build/winCE: added workspace/project files for embeddedVC.
	removed vfw and DS filters, examples and debian folders
	made libxvidcore (w32 and wCE) a static library, not a shared DLL.
	removed plugins from libxvidcore project to compile under VC6/eVC3 without service pack.

	Note: the WinCE version of XviD has no assembler, and thus is usually too slow to be usable for heavy content (Audio + Video), 
	but is reliable enough to use for streaming with packet loss.
