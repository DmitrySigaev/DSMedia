To install Gdiplus SDK on your windows System:

1 - use MS Windows 98 or later, Gdiplus is not supported on Windows95
2 - setup your environment variables (include and lib paths) to point to Gdiplus files
3 - if you are using a WindowsXP system, Gdiplus is distributed with the system so you don't need to use the provided Gdiplus.dll
4 - if you're not using a WindowsXP system, copy Gdiplus.dll in your build directory (recomended by Microsoft) or to your system 
directory (\winnt or \windows) but this is not recomended by Microsoft
