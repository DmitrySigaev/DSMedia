Installation instructions for GPAC v0.2.3 on windows CE platform
last modified: January 2005

0 Foreword
	Compilation has only been tested with eVC3 and ARM platforms
	As of version 0.1.4, GPAC is not considered as stable on CE platform and cannot be tested due to lack of devices. 
	The latest "stable" version known of GPAC on windowsCE devices should be 0.1.3. 

	The 0.2.3 version should be stable on PocketPC (at least it has been compiled and tested on iPaq H3900)
	
	The output directory for all plugins and applications is
		gpac/bin/arm_debug in debug mode
		gpac/bin/arm_release in release mode
	
	As of 0.2.2, GPAC cannot be compiled without ZLIB. You'd better make sure it is installed locally or on your system (zlib is provided in gpac_extra_libs package)
	
I Extra lib installation
	It is recommended to download and compile all extra libs needed by gpac on winCE.
	In case you don't do so, you will need to to modify project settings.


II GPAC compilation

	open /IDEs/eVC3/GPAC.dsw (GPAC workspace) with eVC3
	
	NEVER ATTEMPT TO LOAD A PROJECT OUTSIDE THIS WORKSPACE
	
	II.1 Recompiling M4Systems
		M4Systems is the core library of the GPAC framework used by all GPAC applications 
		Set the "M4Systems_dll" project as the active one
		If you have not installed the SpiderMonkey (JavaScript, libjs) library, remove the M4_USE_SPIDERMONKEY preprocessor variable from the M4Systems project settings (not "M4Systems_dll" !!)
		recompile
	
	II.2 Recompiling Osmo4
		Osmo4 is the GUI MPEG-4 player of GPAC for the windows CE.
		Set Osmo4 as the active project
		recompile

	II.3 Recompiling Plugins
		
		Before compiling GPAC plugins, you must make sure the projects are configured with the right libraries
		* aac_in
			If you have not installed faad2 library, remove the M4_HAS_FAAD preprocessor variable from the aac_in project settings.
			Note that if no aac decoder	is installed for gpac you may as well remove the "aac_in" project from the workspace (DEL).

		* mp3_in
			If you have not installed mad library, remove the M4_HAS_MAD preprocessor variable from the mp3_in project settings.
			Note that if no mp3 decoder is installed for gpac you may as well remove the "mp3_in" project from the workspace (DEL).

		* amr_nb		
			This plugin handles speech coded data using AMR Narrow Band format. It uses the decoder of the 3GPP consortium (TS26.073) available 
			from http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/26_series/26.073/26073-510.zip. 
			It is the same version included in gpac_extra_libs/AMR_NB with a slight header modifcation.
 			To compile this plugin, copy the source code to Plugins/amr_dec/AMR_NB WITHOUT OVERWRITING typedefs.h file.
 			Otherwise, remove the "amr_dec" project from the workspace (DEL).

		* img_in:
			If you have not installed libpng, remove the M4_BUILD_PNG preprocessor variable from the img_in project settings
			If you have not installed libjpeg, remove the M4_BUILD_JPEG preprocessor variable from the img_in project settings
			If none of the above lib is installed, you can simply remove the img_in project from the workspace (DEL).
		
		* ft_font
			if you have not installed freetype, remove the project dependecies to freetype in project Osmo4 and MP4Client
			NOTE: if you have not installed freetype, you won't have text support at all in GPAC.

		* ogg
			if you have not installed libogg library, remove the "ogg" project from the workspace (DEL).
			if you have not installed libvorbis library, remove the M4_HAS_VORBIS preprocessor variable from the ogg project settings
			if you have not installed libtheora library, remove the M4_HAS_THEORA preprocessor variable from the ogg project settings
			Note that if you have only installed libogg you can also remove the "ogg" project from the workspace, it won't be any usefull.
				
		* gapi:
			you must make sure you have installed the GAPI SDK for windows (also known as GX) before compiling - cf gpac_extra_libs/ReadMe

		* svg_loader:
			the svg reader requires libxml2 for SVG parsing. WinCE binaries of LibXML2 are available in gpac_extra_lib package, and can be recompiled from the official libxml2 soiurce tree (http://www.xmlsoft.org).
			To install the precompiled binaries from gpac_extra_lib, copy the gpac_extra_lib/libxml2_arm/include/libxml ENTIRE DIRECTORY in gpac/extra_libs/include, and copy
			gpac_extra_lib/libxml2_arm/lib/libxml2_static.lib to both gpac/extra_lib/lib/arm_debug and gpac/extra_lib/lib/arm_release.
			To install from the official libxm2 source tree, rebuild libxml2for ARM and update svg_loader project settings to pointto the right directories for include and library files.
			If you don't want to install libxml2 or don't plan to test svg, simply remove the "svg_loader" project from the workspace (DEL).

		Recompile all plugins by hand or with a batch buil (menu build->Batch Build -> Build)
						
	II.4 Launching Osmo4
		Osmo4 will automatically create a config file in the Osmo4 executable directory if needed. You must copy all plugins to this directory (recommended), or edit
		by hand the config file "PluginsDirectory" key to point to the plugins directory, otherwise Osmo4 will not launch.
		You can then launch Osmo4 (cf Misc section below)
		
	II.5 Compiling render3D for Osmo4 on CE
		There are no instructions for that, you are left alone. 3D support for handheld devices is comming but not stable enough for Osmo4 to use it. We however recommend using
		the klimt library (http://studierstube.org/klimt/index.php) to build the 3D version. Note that some opengl or GLU primitives are not implemented in klimt therefore
		you will need to modify quite some code in the 3D renderer. You will also have to modify the GAPI video output plugin.

III GPAC Installer for WinCE

		The GPAC installer uses MS installer and EZSetup to get an Osmo4 installer on PocketPC systems
				THIS INSTALLER IS ONLY INTENDED FOR STRONGARM BASED DEVICES
		
		* compile Osmo4 for PocketPC
		* make sure the js.dll is copied in gpac/bin/arm_release if you have compiled GPAC with SpiderMonkey support, otherwise comment lines "js.dll" in osmo4.inf
		* remove any lines in osmo4.inf that refer to plugins you have not built.
		* get MS PocketPC Cabwizard (search for Cabwiz.exe in your ActiveSync distribution)
		* go to gpac/bin/arm_release/install
		* copy cabwiz.exe, cabwiz.ddf and MAKECAB.exe in this directory (or modify your path)
		* copy gx.dll in this directory (download from microsoft, or use gpac extra libs version)
		* get Ezsetup from http://www.eskimo.com/~scottlu/win/, and copy it in this directory
		* run do.bat file
		
IV Misc

	IV.1 Note on Video
		As of 0.2.3, the OpenDivx plugin is no longer included in GPAC. A new, modified version of XviD 1.0 for ARM is included (cf gpac/Plugins/xvid_dec/xvid_wce/ReadMe.txt)
	
	IV.2 Note on Network
		Ipaq devices under WindowsCE below Windows CE .NET 4.1 (and maybe other devices) have a small default UDP buffer size, and this buffer size cannot 
		be changed through WinSock (software) calls. To increase it, you must manually edit the registry and set (add a DWORD key if not present):
					HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Comm\Afd\DgramBuffer 16
		16 is the maximum value possible, DON'T TRY TO SPECIFY MORE.
		The device MUST be reseted (soft reset, cf your manual)	for the parameter to be taken into account.
