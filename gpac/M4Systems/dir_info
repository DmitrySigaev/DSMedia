this is the libm4systems source repository. Sources are sorted by mpeg4 modules


* ./authoring
	Tools for authoring: ISMA, Scene management & parsers, dumpers, media import and export, hinting

* ./BIFS
	BInary Format for Scene coding (decoder and encoder)

* ./ESM
	Elementary Stream Management. The guts of the MPEG4 client performing stream synchronization and 
media object setup, control and decoding. All decoders / network services are abstracted through plugins

* ./IETF
	Small RTP/RTSP/SDP library for the 4onIP framework

* ./MP4
	MPEG4 File Format - features file reading/writing/editing, precise interleaving, hint track creation 
and supports movie fragments (read/write). Includes most of 3GPP and basic AVC support - JPEG2000 support to be done

* ./OD
	Object Descriptor framework: encoding/decoding of all descriptors, OD codec and OCI codec

* ./render
	base renderer handling all common things between 2D and 3D rendering plugins

* ./SceneGraph
	Scene Graph API (MPEG4/VRML/X3D) (BIFS tables are with SGGen application)

* ./Tools
	All generic objects used throughout the lib (list, bitstream, thread, mutex...)
The OS specific files are in dedicated sub_folders (eg ./Tools/w32 for all windows code, ...)
porting the lib means barely porting these files and updating the makefile

* ../include/gpac
	all exported files of the lib (high level APIs). Development headers are <gpac/file>

* ../include/gpac/intern
	all development files of the lib (low level access). Development headers are <gpac/intern/file>
